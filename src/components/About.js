            <p className=" text-justify w-full mt-8">

Before attending Berkeley City College, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree in France with a year abroad at Ball State University in Indiana. After obtaining this degree, I worked for Accenture Operations in Dublin, Ireland, where I provided technical support to Facebook users. In this position, I learned the delicacy of data policies and user safety, as well as the complexity and inner workings of multinational social medias and networks. I quickly began to learn about technology and coding, and eventually learned coding basics on Codecademy, before deciding to move to Silicon Valley to pursue my goal of becoming a software developer and engineer. Ever since I have been working towards this goal with passion and intensity.

            <p className=" text-justify w-full mt-8">As a Software Engineer with experience in a range of programming languages including Java, Javascript, and Python, I am skilled in both front-end and back-end development. I am seeking a junior role where I can continue to grow and develop my skills while making meaningful contributions to the team.
            In my past experience, I have worked on various projects and have consistently delivered high-quality code on time. I am constantly seeking to learn new technologies and am always eager to take on new challenges.

            I am a team player and have had the opportunity to live in four different countries, which has given me a unique perspective and the ability to adapt to new environments quickly. I am excited to connect with other professionals in the tech industry and am open to new opportunities.
