        <p>As a Software Engineer with experience in a range of programming languages including Java, Javascript, and Python, I am skilled in both front-end and back-end development. I am seeking a junior role where I can continue to grow and develop my skills while making meaningful contributions to the team.
In my past experience, I have worked on various projects and have consistently delivered high-quality code on time. I am constantly seeking to learn new technologies and am always eager to take on new challenges. My work can be found on my GitHub repository at https://github.com/Levrairagazzo.
I am a team player and have had the opportunity to live in four different countries, which has given me a unique perspective and the ability to adapt to new environments quickly. I am excited to connect with other professionals in the tech industry and am open to new opportunities.</p>
